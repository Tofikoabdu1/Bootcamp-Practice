    <h1>Meet Whiskers 🐱</h1>
  <p>
    Whiskers is a fluffy little ball of joy with big, curious eyes and a purr that could melt the coldest heart. 
    She spends her days chasing sunbeams across the living room and snuggling into warm blankets like royalty.
    Whether she's playfully batting at imaginary foes or curling up in a perfect loaf shape, Whiskers is the epitome of adorable.
